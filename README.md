# 3D House Scene with Moonlight using Three.js, GSAP

<img src="/public/3d-scene-ss.png" />

This project showcases a 3D house scene illuminated by moonlight, built using Three.js for 3D rendering, GSAP for animations, and React with Vite for development. The scene includes a realistic moonlight effect, providing an immersive visual experience.


## Features

- **3D House Scene**: A detailed 3D model of a house set in a nighttime environment.
- **Realistic Moonlight:** The scene is illuminated by moonlight, creating realistic lighting and shadows.
- **Smooth Animations:** GSAP is used to animate elements in the scene, such as the movement of the moon or other environmental effects.
- **Built with Modern Tools:** Leverages Three.js for the 3D environment, GSAP for animations, and React with Vite for an efficient development process.
